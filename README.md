# btcpay

A simple Go (golang) library for parts of the [BTCPay Greenfield API (v1)](https://docs.btcpayserver.org/API/Greenfield/v1/). See the docs at [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dys2p/btcpay).

## Known issues

The BTCPay Greenfield API provides no way to get the real amount which has been paid. Use the [BitPay API](https://github.com/dys2p/bitpay) for that.
